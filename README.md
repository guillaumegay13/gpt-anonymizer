# gpt-anonymizer: ChatGPT Safe Surf

ChatGPT Safe Surf is a Chrome web extension designed to keep your ChatGPT prompts private. It replaces identifiable entities in your text with fake ones, ensuring your sensitive information remains secure. And don't worry about the response making sense — we'll revert those fake entities to the original ones in ChatGPT's replies. Let's keep your browsing safe and meaningful!

## Features 🌟
- **Anonymize in Real-time**: Replace real entities with fake ones before they are sent out.
- **Accurate Responses**: Get the ChatGPT responses as if you've sent the original content.
- **Easy Toggle**: Easily switch on/off the anonymization as needed.
